I am submitting:
- [ ] a new Extension
- [ ] a new version of an Extension


Description: Explain what the package does and why it's useful.

I have read and followed the submission guidelines and, in particular, I:
- [ ] selected a name that doesn't already exist and represents what my package does. It doesn't have spaces, and different words are linked by "-"
- [ ] added a `extension.toml` file with all required keys
- [ ] added a `README.md` with documentation for my package
- [ ] added the Extension file `{name}.ext.json` to the root of the folder
- [ ] added an `examples` folder with at least one example data file that uses the Extension and shows a few examples for others
- [ ] validated my Extension locally on my system (using [cjval](https://github.com/cityjson/cjval) `--extensionfiles` option)
- [ ] have chosen [a license](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/docs/licensing.md) and added a `LICENSE` file or linked one in my `README.md`
