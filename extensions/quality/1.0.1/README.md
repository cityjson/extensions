# Data Quality extension

Data Quality is a data model that quantitatively describes the degree of closeness between the digital model/representation (‘digital twin’) and the physical reality. Data Quality allows us to determine how suitable the digital model is for a specific use, i.e., “fitness for use”. Therefore, different parts of the Data Quality model represented in this extension will be relevant depending on the use and need of the digital model.
