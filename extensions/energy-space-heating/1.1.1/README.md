# CityJSON Energy Extension for Space Heating Demand Calculation

Copied from <https://github.com/ozgetufan/cjenergy/>, incremented to v1.1.1 so that CityJSON v2.0 is supported (original work was v1.1).

Based on the MSc thesis (at TUDelft) of Özge Tufan ([download PDF](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A0061d94c-46b6-4910-bb73-b6cdc9b85f84?collection=education)).
